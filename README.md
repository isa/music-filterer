This uses echonest api to filter my iTunes library or a given folder based on the music I like.

Nothing complicated..

Currently it only works if the files have the right ID3 tags.

### INSTALLATION

Make sure that you have ffmpeg installed on your system and you do also need id3reader and pyechonest python libraries.
